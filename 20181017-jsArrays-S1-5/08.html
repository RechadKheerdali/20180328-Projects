/*unsatisfied with the result, it works fine but if i answer with the question itself than it comes out as a correct answer when it should not. i have spend some time on it but cannot seem to understand why inputz[i][0] does not work. it should do and tried many other things but none work
+\   anyway i change the if conditions and the current codes is much simpler and i feel silly i did not come up with it on my own as i had a bit of help from the video. lesson learn is to try something else if does not work and look for simpler solutions sometimes   */
