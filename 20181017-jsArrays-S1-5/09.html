    response = response.toLowerCase();   //ik i dont understand why this is not a function.  ik  figured it out, you cannot use parseInt and toLowerCase together as one is converting to string and the other to numbers, they do not mix. so i got rid of the parseInt() in the abov response and now it works.
    // plus i had to turn the array values to string as it will nt make sense for the function if you are calling string and numbers together with the method i am using

    if ( response == answer ){  // with on 2 == equality user is able to type 24 as string and js understand it is a number. could not do that with ===
      //also .toLowerCase() would not work on answer because there is a number on the array , so js wont accept it
