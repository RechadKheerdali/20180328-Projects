 <p id="ik1">Researchers have tried to unpack the paradoxes inherent in coolness, and have focused in particular on the importance to it of violating, or setting oneself apart from, certain dispensable norms. According to the author of a study of cool kids in Japan: "Cool has a brittle cultural logic. It is a residual code that has turned itself into an emergent code. Its performative style is based upon and derives simultaneously from the symbols of both disaffiliation and association." (Maher, 2005)
Being cool, then, means breaking the rules, but only so much. According to one researcher, "The way people and things are cool is if they seem autonomous—they do what they want to do to regardless of what other people think. But in a way that is appropriate, seen as valued or efficient; it’s different, without being harmful or worse." (Warren, 2014)    
 In a sense, coolness mirrors self-actualization. Self-actualizers are people (though rarely teenagers) who think for themselves. They don’t conform to fit in. They’ve evolved beyond basic needs to higher-order needs. Instead of valuing things like belonging, they’ve come to value higher principles like self-sufficiency, beauty, and justice.
Maslow describes self-actualizers as autonomous, standing apart from their culture and environment in important ways. They might break or reject the rules that don’t make sense. They might be detached or asocial at times. They "are not dependent for their main satisfactions on the real world, or other people or culture or means-to-ends, or in general, on extrinsic satisfactions. Rather they are dependent for their own development and continued growth upon their own potentialities and latent resources." (Maslow, 1973, 188)
The self-assuredness of cool kids looks like self-actualization. This is probably a big part of why we admire it to such an extent.</p>
