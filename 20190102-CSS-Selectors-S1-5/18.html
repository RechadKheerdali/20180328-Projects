    <p>"*'&lceil;#Styles will only be applied to the first line of this paragraph.
    After that, all text will be styled like normal. See what I mean?</p>

    <span>The ::first-line and ::first-letter of this text will not receive special styling
    because it is not a block-level element.</span>
    
<!-- IK i think there is a bug in chrome as p line is jumbled together on the ::first-line. maybe it will be fixed by the time i recap. other browser seem to work fine though, and both internal and external stylesheet makes no differences  -->
